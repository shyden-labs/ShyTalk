#
# One-way mirror of .project/stories/SHY-NNNN-*.md files to the GitHub
# Projects v2 board, per the SHY-0082 architecture v4 spec at
# .project/stories/SHY-0082-mirror-v4-typed-issues.md:
#
#   - EVERY story (any type) → a REAL GitHub ISSUE (createIssue) carrying a
#     native issue TYPE (Bug / Feature / Task — org-level issue types) + the
#     full spec body + footer + the `story` marker label, added to the board
#     (addProjectV2ItemById). v4 reverses v3 (which made every card a DRAFT):
#     drafts cannot carry a native type, so typed "tickets" must be real issues.
#     Type map (7 story types → 3 native): bug→Bug; feature→Feature;
#     refactor/docs/infra/spike/chore→Task.
#   - A real issue inherently ALSO appears on the repo's Issues *tab*. That tab
#     stays usable for user bug reports (+ deploy alerts): story-issues carry
#     the `story` label (filter them out) and terminal (Done/Cancelled) issues
#     are CLOSED, so finished work leaves the default open view.
#   - Lifecycle drives the board Status column AND the issue open/closed state:
#     hash-gated body refresh + the body-footer `_Status: X_` marker detect a
#     pure status flip (status lives in frontmatter, outside the body hash);
#     terminal status → issue closed, otherwise open (reconciled on transition).
#   - One paginated items-map query (now selecting the issue body too) feeds
#     every create-vs-update decision.
#   - A legacy DRAFT-backed item (a v3 leftover) is converted: the draft board
#     item is deleted and the story is recreated as a typed issue (the
#     incremental safety net; --rebuild does the bulk migration).
#   - --rebuild (gated on REBUILD_CONFIRM=yes) tears down every board item
#     + every story-labeled issue (delete_issue_node), then resyncs fresh as
#     typed issues — the one-shot migration that converts a v3 draft board to v4.
#
# Defect fixes carried forward from SHY-0067:
#
#   - Defect A (auth env): script + workflow both export GH_TOKEN so the gh
#     CLI authenticates as the PAT (the read-only auto GITHUB_TOKEN can't
#     carry project:write).
#   - Defect B (labels): the five duplicated families (status:/priority:/
#     effort:/type:/roadmap:) are DELETED repo-wide on every run
#     (remove_duplicated_label_families). v4 applies exactly ONE marker label —
#     `story` — to every story-issue (created on first run via
#     ensure_story_label); it identifies corpus issues + lets --rebuild find
#     them via `issue list --label story`. The native issue TYPE replaces the
#     old `type:` label.
#   - Defect C (silent failure): every `gh` invocation captures stderr to a
#     tmpfile; failures log the captured context (no `>/dev/null 2>&1`);
#     N_FAILED > 0 propagates to a non-zero E_API=40 exit at script end.
#   - Defect E (Type field auto-create): script invokes `createProjectV2Field`
#     if the Type single-select field is absent on the board.
#
# Source of truth is the .md file. Change detection is SHA-256 of the file
# body (mid-PR edits share the same commit, so commit-SHA alone is
# insufficient — body-hash is the canonical signal per architect C2).

# AUTH
#   Requires GH_PAT_PROJECT environment variable — a fine-grained PAT
#   scoped to issues:write + pull-requests:write + project:write. The
#   automatic GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions does NOT carry project
#   scopes (architect C1). Operator provisions the PAT and registers
#   it as repository secret GH_PAT_PROJECT.
#
#   Internally, the script re-exports the PAT as GH_TOKEN — that's the
#   env var the gh CLI actually reads (highest priority over
#   GITHUB_TOKEN). The workflow YAML also sets GH_TOKEN at the env block
#   for defense-in-depth.
#
# CONFIG
